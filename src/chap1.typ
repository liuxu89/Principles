= The Principle of Superposition

== The need for a quantum theory
#smallcaps[Classical] Mechanics has been developed continuously from the time of Newton and applied to an ever-widening range of dynamical systems,
including the electromagnetic field in interaction with matter.
//
The underlying ideas and the laws governing their application form a simple and elegant scheme,
which one would be inclined to think could not be seriously modified without having all its attractive features spoilt.
//
Nevertheless it has been found possible to set up a new scheme,
called quantum mechanics,
which is more suitable for the description of phenomena on the atomic scale and which is in some respects more elegant and satisfying than classical scheme.
//
This possibility is due to the changes which the new scheme involves being of a very profound character and not clashing with the features of the classical theory that make it so attractive,
as a result of which all these features can be incorporated in the new scheme.

The necessity for a departure from classical mechanics is clearly shown by experimental results.
//
In the first place the forces known in classical electrodynamics are inadequate for the explanation of the remarkable stability of atoms and molecules,
which is necessary in order that materials may have any definite physical and chemical properties at all.
//
The introduction of new hypothetical forces will not save the situation,
since there exist general principles of classical mechanics,
holding for all kinds of forces,
leading to results in direct disagreement with observation.
//
For example,
if an atomic system has its equilibrium disturbed in any way and is then left alone,
it will be set in oscillation and the oscillations will get impressed on surrounding electromagnetic field,
so that their frequencies may be observed with a spectroscope.
//
Now whatever the laws of force governing the equilibrium,
one would expect to be able to include the various frequencies in scheme comprising certain fundamental frequencies and their harmonics.
//
This is not observed to be the case.
//
Instead,
there is observed a new and unexpected connexion between the frequencies,
called Ritz's Combination Law of Spectroscopy,
according to which all the frequencies can be expressed as differences between certain terms,
the number of terms being much less than the number of frequencies.
//
This law is quite unintelligible from the classical standpoint.

One might try to get over the difficulty without departing from classical mechanics by assuming each of the spectroscopically observed frequencies to be a fundamental frequency with its own degree of freedom,
the laws of force being such that the harmonic vibrations do not occur.
//
Such a theory will not do,
however, even apart from the fact that it would give no explanation of Combination Law,
since it would immediately bring one into conflict with the experimental evidence on specific heats.
//
Classical statistical mechanics enables one to establish a general connexion between the total number of degrees of freedom of an assembly of vibrating systems and its specific heat.
//
If one assumes all the spectroscopic frequencies of an atom to correspond to different degrees of freedom,
one would get a specific heat for any kind of matter very much greater than the observed value.
//
In fact the observed specific heats at ordinary temperatures are given fairly well by a theory that takes into account merely the motion of each atom as a whole and assigns no internal motion to it at all.

This leads us to a new clash between classical mechanics and the results of experiment.
//
There must certainly be some internal motion in an atom to account for its spectrum,
but the internal degrees of freedom,
for some classically inexplicable reason,
do not contribute to the specific heat.
//
A similar clash is found in connexion with the energy of oscillation of the electromagnetic field in a vacuum.
//
Classical mechanics requires the specific heat corresponding to this energy to be infinite,
but it is observed to be quite finite.
//
A general conclusion from experimental results is that oscillations of high frequency do not contribute their classical quota to the specific heat.


As another illustration of the failure of classical mechanics we may consider the behaviour of light.
//
We have, on the one had, the phenomena of interference and diffraction,
which can be explained only on the basis of a wave theory;
on the other, phenomena such as photo-electric emission and scattering by free electrons,
which show that light is composed of small particles.
//
These particles,
which are called photons,
have each a definite energy and momentum,
depending on the frequency of light,
and appear to have just as real an existence as electrons,
or any other particles known in physics.
//
A fraction of photon is never observed.


Experiment have shown that this anomalous behaviour is not peculiar to light,
but is quite general.
//
All material particles have wave properties,
which can be exhibited under suitable conditions.
//
We have here a very striking and general example of the breakdown of classical mechanics---not merely an inaccuracy in its laws of motion but #underline[an inadequacy of its concepts to supply us with description of atomic events.]


The necessity to depart from classical ideas when one wishes to account for the ultimate structure of matter may be seen,
not only from experimentally established facts,
but also from general philosophical grounds.
//
In a classical explanation of the constitution of matter,
one would assume it to be made up of a large number of small constituent parts and one would postulate laws for the behaviour of these parts,
from which the laws of the matter in bulk could be deduced.
//
This would not complete the explanation,
however,
since the question of the structure and stability of the constituent parts is left untouched.
//
To go into this question,
it becomes necessary to postulate that each constituent part is itself made up of smaller parts,
in terms of which its behaviour is to be explained.
//
There is clearly no end to this procedure,
sot that one can never arrive at the ultimate structure of matter on these lines,
//
So long as #underline[big] and #underline[small] are merely relative concepts,
it is no help to explain the big in terms of the small.
//
It is therefore necessary to modify classical ideas in such a way as to give an absolute meaning to size.


At this stage it becomes important to remember that science is concerned only with observable things and that we can observe an object only by letting it interact with some outside influence.
//
An act of observation is thus necessarily accompanied by some disturbance of the object observed.
//
We may define an object to be 
big when the disturbance accompanying our observation of it may be neglected,
and small when the disturbance cannot be neglected.
//
This definition is close agreement with common meanings of big and small.

It is usually assumed that,
by being careful,
we may cut down the disturbance accompanying our observation to any desired extent.
//
The concepts of big and small are then purely relative and refer to the gentleness of our means of observation as well as to the object being described.
//
In order to give an absolute meaning to size,
such as is required for any theory of the ultimate structure of matter,
we have to assume that #underline[there is a limit to the fineness of our powers of observation and the smallness of the accompanying disturbance---a limit which is inherent in the nature of things and can never be surpassed by improved technique or increased skill on the part of the observer.]
//
If the object under observation is such that the unavoidable limiting disturbance is negligible,
then the object is big in the absolute sense and we may apply classical mechanics to it.
//
If, on the other hand,
the limiting disturbance is not negligible, 
then the object is small in the absolute sense and we require a new theory for dealing with it.


A consequence of the preceding discussion is that we must revise our ideas of causality.
//
Causality applies only to a system which is left undisturbed.
//
If a system is small,
we cannot observe it without producing a serious disturbance and hence we cannot expect to find any causal connexion between the results of our observations.
//
Causality will still be assumed to apply to undisturbed systems and the equations which will be set up to describe an undisturbed system will be differential equations expressing a causal connexion between conditions at one time and conditions at a later time.
//
These equations will be in close correspondence with the equations of classical mechanics,
but they will be connected only indirectly with the results of observations.
//
There is an unavoidable indeterminacy in the calculation of observational results,
the theory enabling us to calculate in general only the probability of our obtaining a particular result when wen make an observation.


== The Polarization of photons

The discussion in the preceding section about the limit to the gentleness with which observations can be made and the consequent indeterminacy in the results of those observations dose not provide any quantitative basis for the building up of quantum mechanics.
//
For this purpose a new set of accurate laws of nature is required.
//
One of the most fundamental and most drastic of these is the #underline[Principle of Superposition of States.]
//
We shall lead up to a general formulation of this through a consideration of some special cases,
taking first the example provided by the polarization of light.


It is known experimentally that when plane-polarized light is used for ejecting photo-electrons,
there is a preferential direction for the electron emission.
//
Thus the polarization properties of light are closely connected with its corpuscular properties and one must ascribe a polarization to the photons.
//
One must consider, for instance, a beam of light plane-polarized in a certain direction as consisting of photons each of which is plane-polarized in that direction and a beam of circularly polarized light as consisting of photons each circularly polarized.
//
Every photon is in a certain #underline[state of polarization, ] as we shall say.
//
The problem we must now consider is how to fit in these ideas with the known facts about the resolution of light into polarized components and the recombination of these components.

Let use take a definite case.
//
Suppose we have a beam of light passing through a crystal of tourmaline,
which has the property of letting through only light plane-polarized perpendicular to its optic axis.
//
Classical electrodynamics tells us what will happen for any given polarization of the incident beam.
//
If this beam is polarized perpendicular to the optic axis,
it will all go through the crystal;
if parallel to the axis,
none of it will go through;
while if polarized at an angle $alpha$ to the axis,
a fraction $sin^2 alpha$ will go through.
//
How are we understand these results on a photon basis?


A beam that is plane-polarized in a certain direction is to be pictured as made up of photons each plane-polarized in that direction.
//
This picture leads to no difficulty in the cases when our incident beam is polarized perpendicular or parallel to the optic axis.
//
We merely have to suppose that each photon polarized perpendicular to the axis passes unhindered and unchanged through the crystal,
while each photon polarized parallel to the axis is stopped and absorbed.
//
A difficulty arises,
however, in the case of the obliquely polarized incident beam.
//
Each of the incident photons is then obliquely polarized and it is not clear what will happen to such a photon when it reaches the tourmaline.

A question about what will happen to a particular photon under certain conditions is not really very precise.
//
To make it precise one must imagine some experiment performed having a bearing on the question and inquire what will be the result of the experiment.
//
Only questions about the results of experiments have a real significance and it is only such questions that theoretical physics has to consider.

In our present example the obvious experiment is to use an incident beam consisting of only a single photon and to observe what appears on the back side of the crystal.
//
According to quantum mechanics the result of this experiment will be that sometimes one will find a whole photon,
of energy equal to the energy of the incident photon,
on the back side and other times one will find noting.
//
When one find a whole photon,
it will be polarized perpendicular to the optic axis.
//
One will never find only a part of a photon on the back side.
//
If one repeats the experiment a large number of times,
one will find the photon on the back side in a fraction $sin^2 alpha$ of the total number of times.
//
Thus we may say that the photon has a probability $sin^2 alpha$ of passing through the tourmaline and appearing on the back side polarized perpendicular to the axis and a probability $cos^2 alpha$ of being absorbed.
//
These values for the probabilities lead to the correct classical results for a incident beam containing a large number of photons.


In this way we preserve the individuality of the photon in all cases.
//
We are able to do this,
however, only because we abandon the determinacy of the classical theory.
//
The result of an experiment is not determined,
as it would be according to classical ideas,
by conditions under the control of the experimenter.
//
The most that can be predicted is a set of possible results,
with a probability of occurrence for each.


The foregoing discussion about the result of an experiment with a single obliquely polarized photon incident on a crystal of tourmaline answers all that can legitimately be asked about what happens to an obliquely polarized photon when it reached the tourmaline.
//
Questions about what decides whether the photon is to go through or not and how it changes its direction of polarization when it does go through cannot be investigated b experiment and should be regarded as outside the domain of science.
//
Nevertheless some further description is necessary in order to correlate the results of this experiment with the results of other experiments that might be performed with photons and to fit them all into a general scheme.
//
Such further description should be regarded,
not as an attempt to answer questions outside the domain of science, 
but as an aid to the formulation of rules for expressing concisely the results of large numbers of experiments.


The further description provided by quantum mechanics runs as follows.
//
It is supposed that a photon polarized obliquely to the optic axis may be regarded as being partly in the state of polarization parallel to the axis and partly in the state of polarization perpendicular to the axis.
//
The state of oblique polarization may be considered as the results of some kind of superposition process applied to the two states of parallel and perpendicular polarization.
//
This implies a certain special kind of relationship between the various states of polarization,
a relationship similar to that between polarized beams in classical optics,
but which is now to be applied,
not to beams,
but to states of polarization of one particular photon.
//
This relationship allows any state of polarization to be resolved into.
or expressed as a superposition of,
any two mutually perpendicular states of polarization.


When we make the photon meet a tourmaline crystal,
we are subjecting it to an observation.
//
We are observing whether it is polarized parallel or perpendicular to the optic axis.
//
The effect of making this observation is to force the photon entirely into the state of parallel or entirely into the state of perpendicular polarization.
//
It has to make a sudden jump from being partly in each of these two states to being entirely in one or other of them.
//
Which of the two sates it will jump into cannot be predicted,
but is governed only by probability laws.
//
If it jumps into the parallel state if gets absorbed and if it jumps into the perpendicular state it passes through the crystal and appears on the other side preserving the state of polarization.
